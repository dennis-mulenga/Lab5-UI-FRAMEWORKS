# Lab5-UI-FRAMEWORKS# CSC 4035 Lab 5: UI Frameworks Implementation

## Lab Objectives Achieved
- Implemented Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and React.js components
- Compared utility-first (Tailwind) vs component-based (Bootstrap) approaches
- Created interactive React components with state management
- Applied responsive design principles across all frameworks

## Framework Implementations

### 1. Bootstrap
**Location**: `/bootstrap-demo/services-bootstrap.html`  
**Features**:
- Responsive navbar with dropdown
- Card-based service grid
- Pre-styled components (no custom CSS)
- Alert component for promotions

**Experience**:  
Bootstrap enabled rapid prototyping but felt restrictive for custom designs. The grid system was intuitive but required careful column management.

### 2. Tailwind CSS
**Location**: `/tailwind-demo/index-tailwind.html`  
**Features**:
- Utility-first styling
- Responsive modifiers (e.g., `md:grid-cols-2`)
- Hover/focus states
- Custom animations

**Experience**:  
Tailwind offered more flexibility than Bootstrap. The learning curve was steeper due to numerous utility classes, but resulted in more customized designs.

### 3. React.js
**CodeSandbox**: [Live Demo Link]  
**Features**:
- Stateful contact form
- Form validation
- Component-based architecture
- Declarative UI updates

**Experience**:  
React's component model made the UI more maintainable. State management was clearer than manual DOM manipulation, though JSX took some adjustment.

## Key Learnings
1. **Bootstrap**: Ideal when consistency and speed are prioritized over uniqueness
2. **Tailwind**: Powerful for custom designs but requires memorizing classes
3. **React**: Component reusability justifies initial complexity
4. **Trade-offs**: Each framework has strengths depending on project needs
